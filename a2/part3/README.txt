There arent too many particularities in my assignment. I created a make file for the running and cleanup of the code. 
In my countln.c, it checks to see whether there are any files to open. If there are not, it will end the program.
If there are files to open, the program will run through each argument given by argv and count the amount of lines and words inside of the files
and coontinue this until it reaches the end of the file. At the end, it then prints out the amount of words and lines that are in the code
and terminates the program.
