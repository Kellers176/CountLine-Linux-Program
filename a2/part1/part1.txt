Part 1:
find / \( -type f -o -type d \) -perm -02 -ls 
1) Explain the parameters (command-line arguments) of the above command.
find is used to search for files in a directory hierarchy
/ is used to search the home directory
\( is used to let the program know that there will be a “(“ that it will need to search for. Basically letting it know that there is a argument
-type f is used to search for files 
-o  is the OR operator, meaning that it will either find the left hand side of the command-line arguments, or the right hand side.
-type d is used to search for directories
-perm -02 is used for world writable permissions. All of the permissions are set for the file.
-ls is used to list the contents of the directory


2) One file returned by this command is /tmp. Describe the reason for having that directory world writable. Is the pure “world-writeable” abstraction appropriate for /tmp? If not, what is a reasonable way of constraining it?
One reason having /tmp world writeable is because it allows any program to write to it and then when the user shuts off the computer, the file will permanently be lost and no one will be able to gain access to it again.  I do believe that pure “world-writeable” is appropriate for /tmp. This would mean that it is writeable from no matter what source you come from. In class, we talked about how the modern OS uses /tmp as a memory FS. This means that it allocates part of the ram for itself.

3) Action: Locate all suid and sgid programs. Submit this list (list S) as a part of your report by
constructing an appropriate find command.
For each of the programs taken from list S ind / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -exec ls -l {} \;owned by root:root (user and group), describe the
rationale for making it a suid or a sgid program.

find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -exec ls -l {} \;
